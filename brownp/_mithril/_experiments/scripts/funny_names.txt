Title Screen :

		Yes, this is a Monty Python Rip-Off !

(run it up the screen in as many different languages as possible.)

Cut to high class office with pictures of dead bloody bodies hanging upon the
walls, Pete Brown in a suit is sitting behind a desk, cleaning a bloody knife.

(two knocks on the door, and Pete panics, throws the knife in a drawer and 
puts a handkerchief around his hand.)

PMB: Come in. COME IN!

Man (Ebon or Sean) : Umm, hello, is this the registration office for the cult
    of funny names ?

PMB: Cult?? Shhhh!! (leaps over th desk and puts a hand over the man's mouth)
     What cult, there is no cult here (sweating and jittery)

Man: There is too, look at the pictures on the wall...
