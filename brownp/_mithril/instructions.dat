Information for Play-testers.
	If you have any suggestions on how to improve the game, or make it 
	more interesting or user-friendly, send EMail to BROWNP.
	
	Most rooms and objects are not yet finished, but will be soon.

Concept :
	Single user interactive fiction, where you decide how the plot
	evolves.

	You are an American stuck in Japan in the year 1994.  A great magic
	force has been unleashed...a great orb, and is being used to 
	systematically destroy the world.
	
	Your role:
		Go to the past and destroy the orb (Medeival times)
		Once the orb is destroyed, the force of teh explosion
		knocks you into another dimension, so you must find your
		way out of that dimension.
		Get back to the present (why? because you spent the last 
		6 months compiling a report for your company and you
		dont want to have wasted all that time for nothing...that
		is why you 'save the world')


T e c h   N o t e s :


Moving
	You can leave a room through any of the traditional
	directions (north, south, east, west, up, down) as well as
	the addition of NE SE NW SW.  
	examples:
		> GO south
		> northeast
		> sw
		> up
		> d
		> leave southwest


Objects
	Objects can be reffered to by any of a whole list of synonyms for 
	that object.  You dont have to type just ONE name
		> get a rock
		> get the stone
		> examine pebble
		
		> look at some writing
		> examine the mirror
		> look at the phrase

	Objects can have descriptions up to 12 lines long as well as a label
	description of up to 12 lines long ( one or 2 lines is the norm)
	as well as get success and get failure descriptions, and an official
	name which shows up in your inventory.


Rooms
	Rooms can have descriptions up to 12 lines long.  (see movement for
	information on exits)
	Some rooms have procedures entirely thier own like the bus stop 
	and the vortex room (not yet implemented) .


Monsters
	Not yet implemented


Parser
	The newest version of the parser allows you to type things like :
		> go south
		> south south south south
		> leave nw
		> get all
		> look
		> look at <object>
		> examine <object>
		> drop <object>
		> drop all
		> inventory
		> sit down
		> put a coin in the wallet drop wallet
		> take the coin from the billfold

	And will allow you (in the near future) to type things like :
		> go west then get all but the rock 
		> get (if there is only one object in the room)


Moves
	The game keeps track of the number of legal moves you make and 
	bases your final rank on moves and score. 
	
	Each legal move (except looking at your watch) moves the games
	clock ahead 5 minutes.  Certain things like the sun and moon, the
	bus, and the vortex are based upon the time.

Sun and Moon
	Soon to be implemented is a different room description depending
	upon whether it is day or night.

	Right now, if you are outside, you can see the sun or moon.
