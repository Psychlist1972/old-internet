1 1 You are in Dr Crema Sumdumguiy's bedroom. There is little in the line of
1 2 furniture here, except a bed, a chair and a small closet.  There is a 
1 3 white door to the south, and an archway to the east. 
2 1 You are in Dr Crema Sumdumguiy's workroom.  The floor is covered with 
2 2 parts of computers and automobiles, as well as assorted trash, old food
2 3 and clothes.  There are several benches here covered in small electronic
2 4 components.  An archway leads west, and a small door leads south.
3 1 You are in a filthy bathroom.  Mildew covers the walls, and the tub.
3 2 Typical of a single man, the toilet seat stands proudly uplifted, and 
3 3 shaving cream and soap scum cover the mirror.  You wonder how someone could
3 4 live in a place like this. To the north is a door.
4 1 You are in a plain living room.  All the furniture is covered by white
4 2 sheets, as though someone moved out, or was planning on leaving for a 
4 3 long time.  There is an archway to the north, and an open door to the
4 4 east, from where you can hear traffic.
5 1 You are on the sidewalk right in front of a small building, whichs looks 
5 2 like a laboratory of some sort.  The sidewalk continues south, and there
5 3 is an entrance into the building to the west.  Japanese students flock
5 4 to the north.
6 1 park
7 1 You are strolling in a beautiful scenic park.  Unlike the Americans, the
7 2 Japanese value their open land and dont fill it full of various items of
7 3 junk, like trash and artists selling velvet Elvises.  The park continues
7 4 to the south, west, and the southeast, the entrance is to the east.
8 1 You are strolling along the sidewalk.  The sidewalk continues north and
8 2 south, and there is an entrance to the park to the west.
9 1 park
10 1 park
11 1 park
12 1 You are at the bus stop. Just walking through this section of the sidewalk
12 2 is almost impossible.  Tons of Japanese commuters stand here waiting to
12 3 board the bus.

17 1 You are walking along the sidewalk, near the main bus-route.
18 1 You are at the bus stop at the airport.
18 2 (Type POOF 12 to get out, because this section isnt done yet)
31 1 You are on a bus.  Packed into seats all around are Japanese commuters
31 2 vying to practice their "english" on you.  You politely deny them their
31 3 attention, and let your eyes wander until they rest upon an old
31 4 Japanese lady eating what looks like pickled rag-weed in mustard sauce.
32 1 You are on a bus.  Packed into seats all around are Japanese commuters
32 2 vying to practice their "english" on you.  You politely deny them their

32 4 Japanese lady eating what looks like pickled rag-weed in mustard sauce.
33 1 You are on a bus.  Packed into seats all around are Japanese commuters
33 2 vying to practice their "english" on you.  You politely deny them their

33 4 Japanese lady eating what looks like pickled rag-weed in mustard sauce.
34 1 You are at the bus stop in front of the library.
35 2 (Type POOF 12 to get out, because this section isnt done yet)
50 1 You are at the northwestern-most corner of the castle.  A set of stairs
50 2 leads up, where the only sounds you can hear are wind and the scraping of 
50 3 trees against rock.  There is a small door to the south, and a large,
50 4 beaded and elaborately scrolled archway to the east.
51 1 You have wandered into what could only be described as the remnants of a
51 2 once-beautiful ballroom.  Litter and burn marks scar the floor and walls
51 3 alike.  The broken, decayed bodies lying on the floor speak of a great
51 4 and bloody battle which took place in here.  Oddly, all of the soldiers
51 5 wear the same garb, as though the "enemy" took no damage.  Archways lead
51 6 both east and west.
52 1 You are at the northeastern-most corner of the castle.  A beautiful,
52 2 scrolled archway leads west and a small door leads south.
53 1 You are at the top of a long, dark set of stairs.  Horrible sounds spew
53 2 forth from the moldy depths (or maybe it is just the wind) where the 
53 3 stagnant scents of death and blood seem to overtake the nostrils.  You
53 4 hear the clank of glass, like a small bottle, behind you, but when you
53 5 turn, there is nothing there. 
54 1 You are in a small domed chapel.  A large altar stands cracked in half
54 2 at the western wall, where a tapestry blows in the breeze.  Bloody pews
54 3 fill the room, and not even here is the bloodshed spared.  At the foot of
54 4 altar lies a mangled form, perhaps a priest.  A small door leads to the
54 5 south, and another to the north.
55 1 You are in a small non-descript hallway.  It looks like a hallway.
55 2 To the north is a small door, and to the south is an archway.
56 1 You are at the southwestern-most corner of the castle.  A small wooden
56 2 door leads to the north, and another leads to the east.
57 1 You are Inside the castle entrance.  All seems strangely quiet, the only
57 2 sounds you can hear are the rustling and flapping of tapestries as they 
57 3 blow in the wind.  There is a large wood and iron door to the south and
57 4 two smaller doors leading east and west.

901 1 If only you could...
902 1 That WOULD be a trick.
903 1 You pick it up, but then it jumps right back out of your hands.
904 1 A half-troll probably couldnt even lift that.
905 1 You cant take that!!
906 1 Maybe with a crane...
907 1 NOT!!
908 1 You try to pick the lady up, but she assaults you with her pocket-book.
909 1 Hitting on a priest?  Have you no class?
910 1 You approach the man and he threatens to kill you.
911 1 How would you propose to do that?

1500 1 The stone tablet at its foot is old and weathered, and you cannot make 
1500 2 out the top portion of the text. The rest of it reads:
1500 3 But of course we never see the beginning.  We come in in the middle,
1500 4 after the lights have gone down, and try to make sense of the story so
1500 5 far.  Whisper to our neighbors "Who's he?" "Who's she?"  
1500 6 "Have they met each other before?"  We get by.  In this case, let us
1500 7 imagine our neighbor to be tall, robed perhaps in old, monkish
1500 8 garments, his face hidden in the shadows of his cowl.  He smells of
1500 9 age and dust, not unpleasantly, and in his hands he holds a book.  As
1500 10 he opens the book we hear the clink of metal, and realize the book is
1500 11 chained to his wrist.  (The rest is unintelligable) 
1502 1 After closer examination, you realize that the bundle of sticks is
1502 2 actually a torch.
1503 1 monolith
1504 1 box
1505 1 bird
1506 1 It is a large silver bus packed full of Japanese commuters.  Its door is

1506 3 what??" (In Japanese of course)
1507 1 house
1508 1 It's an old bag with a cane and a shopping bag.  She says something to
1509 2 you in Japanese, but you can't understand her.
1509 1 man
1510 1 priest
1511 1 It is a small smooth stone, just like one you might find on the beach.
1512 1 The sign says something unintelligable in Japanese.  Maybe you should
1512 2 have taken that "Learn Japanese in 2 weeks" course while you had the
1512 3 chance.
1513 1 The writing on the mirror says "Donta Teasa Me!"
1514 1 The bus schedule is in english on one side, and Japanese on the other.

1516 1 The brocure shows some of the nicer areas of Washington DC.

1519 1 It is a small bird cage, I am sure you have seen one before.
1520 1 If you don't know what a wallet looks like, you are in sad shape.
1521 1 It is probably not what you thought it was.  It is a gross, flat, butt-
1521 2 filled hamstered Miller Genuine Draft.  Unfortunately, it gained
1521 3 consciousness when 'Big Snappa' left it to fester for a whole weekend.
1526 1 Dont you know what your own shit looks like.
