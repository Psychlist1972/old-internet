The Top 10 reasons CS majors love to spend 24 hours straight in Wannalancet:


10.  The great air conditioning/ventilation the Dungeon has (NOT!)

 9.  The great Oriental lady who always brings in 'pickled rag weed in mustard
     sauce.' as a midnight snack.

 8.  Used to be the only place you could play lpMUDs from...

 7.  Chances are you'll see Ian Astbury, The Prophet, Skeptor and Karathonius 
     down there, drinking coffee and eating donuts.

 6.  Dont have to worry about Dick Desroches looking over your shoulder if you
     happen to be editing the code for 'Silverdawn'.

 5.  They all know the security guards by name.

 4.  There are always a bunch of 'G-Trade losers' around to rank on..

 3.  There are always a bunch of working terminals. (NOT!)

 2.  Dont have to see the Zoo Crew.

And yes, the number one reason (drum roll please!)

 1.  The Bathrooms are cleaner than the ones in BOGUS!!!
