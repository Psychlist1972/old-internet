 - 'Twas the Night Before Christmas -
 -     (in a manner of speaking)    -
 ------------------------------------
 By Rodger Devlin 
.    'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual
Yuletide celebration.
 .    And throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity was not in
evidence among the possesors of this potential, including that species of
domestic rodent known as `Mus musculus'.
 .    Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the
woodburning caloric apparatus. Pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure rega
rdingan imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folklor
icappelations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas.
 .    The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective
accomodations of repose, were experiencing visual hallucinations of variegat
edfruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums.
 .    Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this
fenestration, noting thereupon that lunar brilliance without, reflected as i
twas on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation, might be said 
torival that of the solar meridian itself, thus permitting my incredulous
optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyanc
edrawn by eight diminutive specimens of the Genus Rangifer.
 .    Piloted by a miniscule, aged chauffer so ebullient and nimble that it
became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller
. .    With his ungulate motive power travelling at what may have been more
vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,
 .    He vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted
labia, and addressed
 each of the octet by his or her respecteive cognomen:
 "Now Dasher ! Now Dancer ! ... ", et al.
 .    Guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through wich
structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32
cloven pedal extremities.
 .    As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location and was in the
process or performing a one hundred and eighty degree pivot, our distingui
shedvisitant acheived with utmost celerity a downward leapentry by way of the
smoke passage. .  
  Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smokingpiece whose grey fumes,
forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative
seasonal circlet of holly.
 .    His visage was wider than it was high.
 .    And when he waxed audibly mirthiful, his corpulent abdominal region
undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical
container. .    Without utterance, and with dispatch, he commenced filling the
aforementioned hoisery with various of the aforementioned articals of
merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously dorsally transp
ortedcloth receptacle.
 .    He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed
a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the
antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement
hitherto observable cheifly among the seed-bearing portions of a common we
ed. .    But I overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediatly prior to 
hisvehiculation beyond the limits of visibility:
 .    `Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency; and to that selfsa
meassemblage my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial gratifyingl
ypleasurable period between sunset and dawn.'

  How the Angel came to adorn the top of the Christmas Tree
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Submitted by, Leslie Summer
 Santa  had  sat down in his Lazy Boy recliner in front of the fireplace to
toast his feet - it was Christmas Eve and it would  be  a  long night.  
 He'ddozed off and now woke to find it was 11:30 - he knew he had to be out of
there by midnight or he'd never  finish  his rounds bringing toys to all the
little boys and girls all over the world.
 Mrs.  Claus had let him sleep this year - she still remembered last year whe
nshe woke him up and the old man had gotten cranky with  her - said she wo
kehim up too early ...
 Santa  got out of his nice warm chair and ran to the bedroom to get dressed 
-there was his suit all ready to go way in the back  of  the closet ...  He
pulled on his long johns, his bright red top, his just as bright pants, and
was bending over to pick up his hat -  RIPPPP! - his pants tore.
 Santa looked at the time - it was 25 'till 12 ...
 He went out to his little tailor elves and said "Here boys, put a few sti
chesin these britches for me, would 'ya please?"; And they  did.
 It was now 20 minutes 'till.
 Santa  went back inside - "Mother!  - where's my boots?",   "Out on the bac
kporch right where you left 'em last  year,  dear",  she  answered.   San
tawent out back to the porch they'd added to their house trailor a few yea
rs ago.... His boots were there alright,  but you know how boots get all dried out
and stiff when you let 'em sit like that after the've been all wet.  He p
ulledon the right  one,  then the left one - took two steps back inside,  and 
theheel broke off the right one - Santa looked at the time ....  it  was  g
ettinglater and later.   He kinda hobbled outside and found his little cobbler
elves; "Here son, pu
t a few nails in this heel for  me, would ya?" - and he
did. It was now a quarter 'till ....
 Santa  now started running towards the corral to get the reindeer - half way
there he stepped on the rake he'd left out there eight  months ago - WHAM!
 -it hit him right 
square in the nose - Santa let out such a yelp that he
spooked the reindeer right over the top  rail  on  their pen ....  He ra
n backto the little cowboy elves bunk house and said "Boys,  saddle up your ponys
and round up  them  reindeer, would 'ya?"
 While they were ou
t gettin the reindeer rounded up, Santa went to the barn to
get the sleigh out.  He started to push it over to  the front of their traile
rand the left runner broke off!  He pushed the sleigh back into the barn and
called his blacksmith elf out  of bed and said "Son, weld this runner back
 on,would 'ya?"; an
d he did. It was now almost five 'till ......
 The cowboys had now got the reindeer rounded up and in their harnesses and
hitched the harness up to the sleigh.  With a crack  of  the  whip the
reindeer were off - but the sleigh stayed put ...  the leather stays had
snapped. Santa called for the cowboy elves,  "You  boys  get them reindeer
rounded up again!";  And they did ...  Santa had the cobbler elf put som
erivets in  the harness  and  finally got the sleigh in the front of the ho
use... It was now one minute 'till .....
 Santa  ran into the trailer to grab the big sack of toys.   He latched o
nto itand with a mighty tug,  hefted it onto his shoulder -  RIP!  - The  bottom
tore out and toys went everywhere!   ....  He was scrambling all over pick
in'up those toys to put in some  old  grocery  bags  - all the time worrying
about the hour - when a little Angel came through the front door with a
beautiful Christmas  tree over her shoulder and asked "Santa, where to you
want me to put this tree?"
