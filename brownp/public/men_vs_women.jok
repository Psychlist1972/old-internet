   On Men and Women

On the subject of men:  I've been a member of the gender for 24
years.  I've stumbled through many of the stages of becoming a man,
including wildly irregular voice changes at the age of 12, acne
attacks in my teens, major crushes on girls who still do not know I
am alive and periods of time when I knocked over or broke everything
in sight because I had grown seven inches if four days.

Regarding women:  You could take what I know about women and place
this information in a hollowed-out walnut shell, and still have room
left for a network executive's brain.  But that has not stopped me
from observing, questioning, applauding, admiring, and wondering
about women.

One basic truth:  Men and women are different.

Now, this may seem a little simplistic, but the fact is, for a period
of about six months in 1973, it was very fashionable to believe that
we were all persons first, and members of our gender second.

This, of course, was so much hooey.

We are different -- in our habits, and in the way we react to
environmental stimuli and the way we spend our leisure time; and we
are especially different when it comes to our attitudes regarding
relationships.

My personal observations have uncovered many significant differences
between men and women.

Relationships

First of all, a man does not call a relationship "a relationship."  He
refers to it as a romance, or a period of dating, of going out, or, in some
unfortunate circumstances, "that time when me and Suzie was doing it on a
semi-regular basis."

When a relationship ends, a woman will cry, and pour her heart out to
her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled "All Men are
Idiots."  Then she will get on with her life.

A man has a little more trouble letting go.  For six months, his ex
may not hear from him, but then, at three on Saturday night/Sunday
morning, he will call and say, "I just wanted to let you know you
ruined my life, and I'll never forgive you, and I hate you, and
you're a total floozy.  But I want to let you know there's always a
chance for us."

This is known as the "I Hate You/I Love You" drunken phone call.
Ninety-nine percent of all men past the age of 21 have made this call
at least once.  Some men make a career of these calls.  There are
community colleges that offer extension courses to help men get over
this need; alas, these classes rarely prove effective.

Sex

Women prefer 30 to 45 minutes of foreplay.  Men prefer 30 to 45
seconds of foreplay.  For the man, driving back to her place is
considered a part of foreplay.






Maturity

Women mature at a much faster rate than men.  Most 17 year old
females can function as adults.  Most 17 year old males are still
trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class.
This is why high school romances rarely work.

Hats

Women look good in hats; men look like dinks.

Groceries

A woman knows how to shop for groceries.  She makes a list of the
things she needs, and then goes to the store and buys these things.
A man does not shop on a frequent basis.  He waits until the only
items left in his refrigerator are an opened can of Schlitz and a
half a lime.  Then he goes grocery shopping.  A man buys everything
that looks good.  By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his
cart is packed tighter than the Clampett's car on the Beverly
Hillbillies.  Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10
items or less lane.

Magazines

Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked ladies.  Women's
magazines also feature pictures of naked ladies.  This is because the
female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy
and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day.

Handwriting

To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship.  They just
chickenscratch.  Women use scented, colored stationary, and they dot their
"i's" with circles and hearts.  Women use ridiculously large loops in their
"p's" and "g's."  It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman.  Even when
she's dumping you, she'll put a smiley face at the end of the note.

Comedy

Let's say a small group of men and women are in a room, watching
television, and an episode of the Three Stooges comes on.
Immediately, the men will get very excited; they will laugh
uproariously, and even try to imitate the actions of Curly, man's
favorite stooge.  The woman will roll their eyes and groan and wait it
out.

Bathrooms

A man has 6 items in his bathroom:  a toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving
cream, a razor, a bar of Dial soap and a towel from a Holiday Inn.
The average number of items in a typical American women's bathroom is
437.  A man would not be able to identify most of these items.

Going Out

When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go
out.  When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she will be
ready, as soon as she finds her other earring, makes one phone call
and finishes putting on her makeup.






Cats

Women love cats.  Men say they love cats, but when women aren't
looking, men kick cats.

Shoes

When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then
slip into Reebok sneakers.  She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag
from Saks.  When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes.
Five minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the
desk.  A man will wear one pair of shoes for the entire day.

Leg Warmers

Leg warmers are sexy.  A woman, even if she's walking the dog or
doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers.  She can wear them
any time she wants.  A man can only wear leg warmers if he is
auditioning for the "Gimme the Ball" number in A Chorus Line.

Mirrors

Men are vain; they will check themselves out in the mirror.  Women are
ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface,
mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, or Joe Garagiola's head.

Menopause

When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated
emotional, psychological, and biological changes.  The nature and degree of
these changes varies with the individual.  Menopause in a man provokes a
uniform reaction -- he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather
driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.

The Telephone

Men see the telephone as a communication tool.  They use the
telephone to send short messages to other people.  A woman can visit
her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call
the same friend and they will talk for three hours.

Offspring

Ah, children.  A woman knows all about her children.  She knows about
dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends
and favorite foods and hopes and dreams.  A man is vaguely aware of some
short people living in his house.

Low Blows

Let's say a man and a woman are watching a boxing match on television.  One
of the figures is felled by a low blow.  The woman says, "Oh gee, that must
hurt."  The man doubles over and actually feels the pain.

Directions

If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings,
she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions.  Men consider this to
be a sign of weakness.  Men will never stop and ask for directions.  Men
will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, "Looks
like I've found a new way to get there." and, "I know I'm in the general
neighborhood.  I recognize that White Hen store."



Admitting Mistakes

Women will sometimes admit making a mistake.  The last man who admitted he
was wrong was General George Custer.

Richard Gere

Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way.  Men hate
Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the
health club and dates only married women.

Dressing Up

A woman will dress up to:  go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage,
answer the phone, read a book, get the mail.  A man will dress up for:
weddings, funerals.

Nicknames

With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like
"Ultimate Pecs" and "Big Turk," women eschew the use of nicknames.  If
Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will
call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle.  But if Mike, Dirk,
Clint, and Jack go out for a brewski, they will affectionately refer to one
another as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.

Toys

Little girls love to play with toys.  Then when they reach the age of 11 or
12, they lose interest.  Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As
they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and
impractical.  Examples of men's toys:  little miniature TV's.  Car phones.
Complicated juicers and blenders.  Graphic equalizers.  Small robots that
serve cocktails on command.  Video games.  Anything that blinks, beeps, and
requires at least 6 "D" batteries to operate.

Plants

A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation.  The man
waters the plants.  The woman comes home five or six days later to an
apartment full of dead plants.  No one knows why this happens.

Mustaches

Some men look good with mustaches.  Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt
Reynolds.  There are no women who look good with mustaches.

David Letterman

Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the Earth.
Women think he is a mean, semidorky guy who always has a bad haircut.

Cameras

Men take photography very seriously.  They'll shell out $4000 for state of
the art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography classes.  Women
purchase Kodak Instamatics.  Of course women always end up taking better
pictures.

Locker Rooms

In the locker room men talk about three things:  money, football, and women,
They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they




think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one
thing in the locker room -- sex.  And not in abstract terms, either.  They
are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.

Laundry

Women do the laundry every couple of days.  A man will wear every article of
clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were really hip about
eight years ago, before he will do the laundry.  When he is finally out of
clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatsuit inside out, rent a U-Haul and take
his mountain of dirty clothes to the Laundromat.  Men always expect to met
beautiful women at the Laundromat, but this is only a myth perpetuated by
old reruns of Love American Style.


Politics

Men love to talk
