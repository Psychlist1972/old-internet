Smoke and fire,
water and ice.
Why so dire,
yet so nice?

You all can kill
without word or sound
submit to your will
or be smothered all around.

To much of one,
not enough of the other
Some you take for fun,
some from their mother.

But take me you'll not
for I have yet to find
either frozen or too hot
that your not just in my mind.
