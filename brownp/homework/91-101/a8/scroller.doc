o  Program Purpose :

	To show the practical application of concepts known to enhance
	the ergonomics of a program.


o  How to use Scroller :

	When in doubt, look at the "valid keys" bar at the right of the 
	display.  It contains the valid keys a user may press at any
	given time.

	If you press an invalid key and you haven't set the AUTO_HELP to
	OFF, then a help window will pop up.  If AUTO_HELP is set to OFF,
	then a tone will sound indicating an invalid keypress.


	o  To scroll through text :

		Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll line by line.  Use
		D and U for page down and page up respectively.

		If you wish to see this file during runtime, simply change
		teh current path to SCIENCE$DISK:[BROWNP.HEINESJ] and the
		current file to SCROLLER.DOC.


	o  To access the pulldown menus :

		Use the "hot keys" (H F E O) or Press "t" for TOP, or use
		the standard way of changing modes; hit ESCape twice.

		If all else fails, hit escape twice.


	o  To select a menu option :
		
		Hit return when the desired option has been highlighted.

		Most options will produce a window on the screen.  Options
		that toggle settings, and have no need of a dialog box, will
		not produce a window of any kind.

		Note: Options preceded by the "NOT" (~) or "tilde" are not 
		      functional options.  Perhaps they will be at a later date.


o  Documented Bugs :

	1.  There is a bug with either WINWRITEAT, WINBOX or WINRESTORE
	    which makes the screen refresh oddly (shifted to the right one
	    character) under certain conditions.


	2.  Not a bug, but an ineffeciency.  When the clock is toggled OFF,
	    the program will still go through the trouble of refreshing the
	    area where the clock was with a blank string.

	3.  Not a bug, but an ineffeciency.  My dialogue boxes that prompt
	    for a string get input character by character.  You cannot 
	    delete a previous character or in any way edit the string.

	    BUT, folks, if memory served me, assignment 9 is linked lists
	    and that is teh way of fixing this problem.

	    The only reason I do it this way now is so no one writes a 
	    string so long it oversteps the boundries of the popup window.


* Remember, it's not a bug...it's an undocumented feature !
